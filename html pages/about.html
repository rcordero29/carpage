      <div class='text'><h2>Where We Started</h2> <p>What began as merely a hobby in his household garage grew exponentially from a part-time trade to a lifelong pursuit. Since his first high performance car, a Nissan 350Z to a Lexus IS-F, he has crafted his passion into every facet of the vehicle, from car performance to flawless paint finishing. His collection expanded to include a rare Nismo S-Tune R34 Nissan Skyline GT-R , 2013 Nissan GT-R.

      <h4>"OVERWHELMINGLY IMPRESSED"</h4>
      <p>Unfortunately, if you search the internet or ask around, you will likely come up with a handful of companies that do “hand car washes and professional detail.” These are the places you see on the side of the road with a large tent that have cars lined up waiting to get washed. While those types of establishments may work for the day-to-day wash and detail for the non-car fanatic, they certainly don’t cut it when it comes to getting a flawless finish. After scouring the internet, I came across Vivë. When I got my car back, I was overwhelmingly impressed. The car didn’t just shine, it glowed. There truly is no other service like what Ruben offers in the San Antonio area.</p>

    <div><h4> "BEYOND SPECTACULAR"</h4>
      <p>I don’t usually post reviews unless I am upset. I am so happy to say that my experience with Ruben was nothing short of amazing. Vivë was very passionate about their work and made it a point to say that if anything is ever done incorrectly or not to my satisfaction, it would be re-done until it was perfect. Their sincerity and honesty won me over and I handed over the keys to what I consider my child. Vivë is above and beyond spectacular. Literally every single person I have dealt with there, is extremely professional and just an overall good person. I love them all and I am lucky to have found them. You guys are amazing.</p>
